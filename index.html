    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <section id="overview">
      <h1>Reforestation Can Help Repair the Damage Caused by Deforestation</h1>

      <p>
        Deforestation is one of the most serious environmental problems facing the world today.
        Forests are being destroyed at alarming rates due to human activity. While forests may
        seem endless, they are actually limited and extremely important to life on Earth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Trees help regulate climate, store carbon, protect soil, and provide homes for millions
        of plant and animal species. When forests are removed, these natural systems break down.
        This leads to climate change, habitat loss, and environmental instability.
      </p>

      <p>
        Reforestation offers a realistic and effective solution. By planting trees and restoring
        damaged forest areas, humans can reduce carbon levels, protect biodiversity, and create
        a healthier planet for future generations.
      </p>

      <div class="quote">
        <strong>Thesis:</strong> Reforestation and afforestation directly address the damage caused
        by deforestation by capturing carbon, restoring ecosystems, and stabilizing the global climate.
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- PROBLEM -->
    <section id="problem">
      <h2>The Problem: Global Deforestation</h2>

      <p>
        Deforestation refers to the large-scale removal of forests, usually to make room for
        agriculture, logging, or urban development. Each year, millions of acres of forest land
        are destroyed, especially in tropical regions.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Amazon Rainforest, often called the “lungs of the Earth,” has lost vast amounts of
        forest cover over the past several decades. Similar destruction is occurring in
        Southeast Asia and Central Africa.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once forests are removed, the land often becomes dry, infertile, and vulnerable to erosion.
        This makes it difficult for ecosystems to recover naturally.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- CAUSES -->
    <section id="causes">
      <h2>Main Causes of Deforestation</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Forests are cleared to grow crops and raise livestock.</li>
        <li><strong>Logging:</strong> Trees are cut for wood, paper, and construction materials.</li>
        <li><strong>Urban Expansion:</strong> Cities and roads replace forest land.</li>
        <li><strong>Mining:</strong> Natural resources are extracted at the cost of ecosystems.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These activities often prioritize short-term economic gain over long-term environmental
        health. In many cases, forests are destroyed faster than they can regenerate.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- EFFECTS -->
    <section id="effects">
      <h2>Environmental Effects of Deforestation</h2>

      <p>
        One of the most serious effects of deforestation is climate change. Trees absorb carbon
        dioxide, a major greenhouse gas. When trees are removed, this carbon is released back
        into the atmosphere.
      </p>

      <p>
        Deforestation also disrupts the water cycle. Forests help control rainfall and prevent
        flooding. Without trees, areas become more prone to droughts and natural disasters.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wildlife is also heavily impacted. Many species lose their habitats and are pushed toward
        extinction as forests disappear.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SOLUTION -->
    <section id="solution">
      <h2>The Solution: Reforestation and Afforestation</h2>

      <p>
        Reforestation involves replanting trees in areas where forests once existed. Afforestation
        involves planting trees in areas that previously had no forest cover.
      </p>

      <p>
        These practices help absorb carbon dioxide, improve air quality, restore habitats, and
        strengthen ecosystems. When done correctly using native species, reforestation can be
        highly effective.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Reduces carbon emissions</li>
        <li>Improves soil quality</li>
        <li>Restores wildlife habitats</li>
        <li>Supports local communities</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- COUNTERARGUMENT -->
    <section id="counter">
      <h2>Counterargument and Rebuttal</h2>

      <p>
        Some critics argue that reforestation takes too long and cannot fix climate change on its
        own. While it is true that trees need time to grow, reforestation is meant to work alongside
        other solutions like renewable energy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Reforestation removes carbon that is already in the atmosphere, something many other
        solutions cannot do. Because of this, it remains an essential part of climate action.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- ACTION -->
    <section id="action">
      <h2>Call to Action</h2>

      <p>
        Individuals and governments must take action to protect existing forests and support
        reforestation efforts. Even small actions can make a difference.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Support laws that protect forests</li>
        <li>Reduce use of deforestation-linked products</li>
        <li>Donate to environmental organizations</li>
        <li>Raise awareness about deforestation</li>
      </ul>
